= Argentum ToolKit. Rest generator.

== Restrictions

- supports only `$ref` params in case if OpenAPI objects supports `$ref`. (Doesn't support embedded objects in this case)
- we don't use OpenAPI tags. If you need similar functionality, we would like to recommend split your API to packages

== Features

- Generated code compatible with Argentum REST
- Schemas supports only Object type (Array, AnyOf, AllOf are not implemented yet)
